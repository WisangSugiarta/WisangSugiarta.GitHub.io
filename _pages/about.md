### Hello, I'm Wisang! 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in computational physics at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Broadly, I'm interested in solving hard physics problems (fluids, meteorology and mechanics). Most of my research relates to [PhyPID](https://phypid.org/), and I work on projects like [RDycore](https://rdycore.github.io/), [Petsc](https://petsc.org/release/), [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [E3SM](https://www.sandia.gov/energy/tag/e3sm-project/).


I was previously a quant at Morgan Stanely working on computational libraries and data science applications in finance. I completed an M.Sc at the University of Montreal and [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en) with [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/). My thesis explored using a combination of mathematical optimization and machine learning (Decision-Focused Learning) to solve a network problem. I also graduated from McGill University with a B.Sc in Physics and Computer Science.

Outisde of that, I'm pretty into climbing, biking and hockey (for which Boulder is great!).
