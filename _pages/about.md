### Hello, I'm Wisang! 

I'm currently a research assistant in computational physics in the [PhyPID](https://phypid.org/) group at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 

I was previously a quant at Morgan Stanely working on computational libraries and data science applications in finance. I completed a M.Sc at the University of Montreal and [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en) where my advisor was [Emma Frejinger](https://www.emmafrejinger.org/). My thesis explored using a combination of mathematical optimization and machine learning (Decision-Focused Learning) to solve a network problem. I attended McGill University for undergrad in Physics and Computer Science.

Outisde of that, I'm pretty into climbing, biking and hockey (for which Boulder is great!).
