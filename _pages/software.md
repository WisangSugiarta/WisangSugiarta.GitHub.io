I try to list the projects, academic and less so, here. I'm still building this site so it' a work in progress!

[![R build status](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst/actions)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BayesPostEst)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesPostEst)
[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst?branch=master)

I am a developer of the [BayesPostEst](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesPostEst) R package for generating postestimation quantities of interest from Bayesian models. The package contains functions for producing regression tables, plotting predicted probabilities, calculating first differences, creating coefficient plots, and many other quantities. You can view the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) article for the package [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01722).

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("BayesPostEst")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst")
```
